# Banking-System-in-java-
Java program defines a simple banking system with abstract classes, interfaces, and concrete classes. The program includes a BankAccount abstract class, SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount concrete classes that extend BankAccount, and an RBI interface. The main class, bankabstractggs, allows users to interact with instances of SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount by performing operations like deposit, withdrawal, and interest calculation.

Here's a brief summary of the program:

Interface RBI:

Contains constants mins and minc.
Declares the method calculateInterest().
Abstract class BankAccount:

Contains common attributes like account number, balance, customer name, city, and deposit.
Defines methods inputdata(), display(), deposit(), and withDraw() as abstract.
Concrete class SavingsAccount:

Extends BankAccount and implements RBI.
Implements the abstract methods deposit(), withDraw(), and calculateInterest().
Concrete class CurrentAccount:

Extends BankAccount and implements RBI.
Implements the abstract methods deposit(), withDraw(), and calculateInterest().
Main class bankabstractggs:

Takes user input to create instances of SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount.
Uses a menu-driven approach to allow users to perform various operations on the accounts.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Code Structure:

Consider breaking down your code into smaller methods for better readability and maintainability.
Use more descriptive variable and method names.
Exception Handling:

Add exception handling to handle potential input errors (e.g., InputMismatchException).
Encapsulation:

Encapsulate the attributes of the classes by making them private and providing getters and setters.
Comments:

Add comments to explain complex logic, especially within the calculateInterest() method.
Constant Naming:

Follow naming conventions for constants. Constants are usually named in uppercase with underscores.
Validation:

Consider adding validation checks for user inputs to ensure the program behaves as expected.
